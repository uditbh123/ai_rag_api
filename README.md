# AI RAG API

A production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) API built with FastAPI that enables semantic search and question-answering capabilities over custom documents.

## 🌟 Overview

This project implements a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that makes AI smarter by giving it access to your own custom knowledge base. Built with FastAPI, it uses local AI models (Ollama + TinyLlama) and vector databases (ChromaDB) to provide accurate, context-aware answers based on your specific documents—without expensive API costs or privacy concerns.

**Part 1 of the NextWork AI DevOps Series** - This is the foundational RAG API that will be containerized, automated, and monitored in future projects.

## 🚀 Features

- **Local AI Models**: Uses Ollama with TinyLlama to run AI locally—no expensive API costs
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB stores embeddings for semantic search based on meaning, not just keywords
- **Document Ingestion**: Convert text documents into vector embeddings for your knowledge base
- **Intelligent Querying**: Ask questions and get accurate answers based on your specific documents
- **FastAPI Backend**: High-performance async API with automatic Swagger UI documentation
- **No Hallucinations**: AI responses are grounded in your actual documents, preventing made-up answers
- **Privacy-First**: All data stays local on your machine

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) installed locally
- pip for package management
- Basic understanding of REST APIs

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Install Ollama**
   
   Download and install Ollama from [https://ollama.ai/](https://ollama.ai/)
   
   Pull the TinyLlama model:
   ```bash
   ollama pull tinyllama
   ```

2. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/uditbh123/ai_rag_api.git
   cd ai_rag_api
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn chromadb ollama langchain
   ```

## 🎯 Usage

### The RAG Workflow

This project follows a two-step process:

1. **Ingestion**: Embed your documents into ChromaDB
2. **Query**: Ask questions and get AI-generated answers based on your documents

### Step 1: Embed Documents

First, create your knowledge base. For example, create a file `k8s.txt` with information about Kubernetes, then run:

```bash
python embed.py
```

This converts your text into vector embeddings and stores them in ChromaDB.

### Step 2: Start the API

Start the FastAPI server:
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### Step 3: Query Your Knowledge Base

**Using curl:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is Kubernetes?"}'
```

**Using Swagger UI:**

Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for an interactive interface where you can test queries directly in your browser.

### How It Works

1. **User asks a question** via the `/query` endpoint
2. **ChromaDB retrieves** the most relevant text snippets from your documents
3. **Context is sent** to TinyLlama along with the question
4. **AI generates** an accurate answer based on your specific knowledge base

### Example: Before vs After RAG

**Without RAG (Hallucination):**
- Question: "What is Kubernetes?"
- Answer: "A type of dessert" ❌

**With RAG (Accurate):**
- Question: "What is Kubernetes?"  
- Answer: "Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform..." ✅

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

This is **Project 1** in a 4-part series:

- ✅ **Project 1**: Build the RAG API (Current)
- ⏳ **Project 2**: Containerize with Docker
- ⏳ **Project 3**: Automate with GitHub Actions  
- ⏳ **Project 4**: Monitor with Grafana dashboards

## 🧪 Testing

Test your API to ensure it's working correctly:

1. **Health Check**: Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser
2. **Interactive Testing**: Use Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8000/docs`
3. **Command Line**: Use curl commands to test the `/query` endpoint

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **FastAPI**: Modern web framework for building APIs
- **Ollama + TinyLlama**: Local AI model for generation
- **ChromaDB**: Vector database for storing embeddings
- **LangChain**: Framework for building LLM applications
- **Python**: Programming language

## 📊 API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | Health check and API info |
| `/query` | POST | Query the RAG system with a question |
| `/docs` | GET | Interactive Swagger UI documentation |

## 💡 Key Concepts

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  
Instead of the AI making things up, RAG grounds responses in your actual documents. It retrieves relevant information first, then generates an answer.

**Vector Embeddings**  
Your text is converted into numerical representations that capture meaning, allowing semantic search (searching by concept, not just keywords).

**Local AI**  
Using Ollama and TinyLlama means no API costs, better privacy, and full control over your AI stack.
